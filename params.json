It also comes with Brill.css and themes.css.\r\n\r\nHow to use it\r\n============\r\n\r\nTo start using it, make a variable called app (or whatever you want). Inside app, write this: <code>new Brill([]);</code>\r\nYou can put anything you want in that array. It will just get returned.\r\n\r\nIn v1, there is a number of functions. To use the map function, simply write <code>app.map(callback);</code> You really should look in the library.\r\n\r\nIf you have any ideas or improvements, please comment.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
