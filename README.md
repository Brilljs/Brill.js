Brill.js
========

Brill.js is a library that works with the DOM and server. It also comes with Brill.css and themes.css.
The css files are still under progress, so don't use them.

How to use it
============


To start using it, make a variable called app (or whatever you want). Inside app, write this: <code>new Brill([]);</code>
You can put anything you want in that array. It will just get returned.

In v1, there is a number of functions. To use the map function, simply write <code>app.map(callback);</code> You really should look in the library.

If you have any ideas or improvements, please comment.
